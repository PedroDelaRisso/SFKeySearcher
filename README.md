# SFKeySearcher
SoulFrame key searcher.

A quick project done using Vite, Deno, TypeScript, Axios, React and Tailwindcsss. This app consumes the reddit API to search for comments on the [subreddit r/SoulFrame code sharing megathread](reddit.com/r/SoulFrame/comments/1ih1iit) and prints them on screen if they contain SoulFrame keys.

Disclaimer: this repo exists only to facilitate finding comments containing keys, it ***does not*** generate valid codes and doing so is against SoulFrame's terms of service and I do not condone or encourage it.

### Running

You need to have [Deno](https://deno.com) v2.0.0 or later installed to run this repo.

Start a dev server:

```
$ deno task dev
```
